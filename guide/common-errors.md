# Common Errors

## Cannot find module './relative-path'

If you receive an error that module cannot be found, it might mean several different things:

- 1. You misspelled the path. Make sure the path is correct.

- 2. It's possible that your rely on `baseUrl` in your `tsconfig.json`. Vite doesn't take into account `tsconfig.json` by default, so you might need to install [`vite-tsconfig-paths`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-tsconfig-paths) yourself, if you rely on this behaviour.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tsconfigPaths()]
})
```

Or rewrite your path to not be relative to root:

```diff
- import helpers from 'src/helpers'
+ import helpers from '../src/helpers'
```

- 3. Make sure you don't have relative [aliases](/config/#alias). Vite treats them as relative to the file where the import is instead of the root.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    alias: {
      '@/': './src/', // [!code --]
      '@/': new URL('./src/', import.meta.url).pathname, // [!code ++]
    }
  }
})
```
